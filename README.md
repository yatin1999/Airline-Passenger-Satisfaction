# Airline_Passenger_Satisfaction
### About the Dataset
The dataset for this project consists of airline passengers, their experience of the flight and their satisfaction will be used. The training dataset has 103904 entries and the majority does not have any null values at first glance. Furthermore, the dataset includes approx. 23 variables including the satisfaction variable which will become key in the latter stages of this project. In addition, the majority of the dataset consists of numerical values though some of these relate to the customer's observation of the service such as "Checking service". In this specific part of the project, each variable will be examined in turn to understand how overall satisfaction is distributed.
